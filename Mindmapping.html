<div class="header2"><strong>What is Mind Mapping?</strong><br><br>Using an organized layout to express thoughts, concepts, and data around a main topic, <strong> Mind mapping </strong> is a visual technique. The main idea, which is frequently shown at the center of the map, branches out into subtopics and then subbranches into more specific details. Essential information is captured and communicated succinctly through the use of keywords, brief sentences, and even visuals.
